Since Dragonfly is still in its early stages, there aren't any prebuilt executables. These may be provided when Dragonfly becomes more stable. Instructions and a tutorial video can be found below.

## Installation as library
The following commands assume you have created a new directory for your Go project, and you are trying to import dragonfly.
```shell
go mod init github.com/<user>/<module> # Insert your own username and project name here.
go get github.com/df-mc/dragonfly
```
